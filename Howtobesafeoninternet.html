<h1 class="title2">Ways to be safe using internet</h1>
<div class="Div1">
    <h2>Don’t share your personal information</h2>
    <p>When it comes to online safety, it goes without saying that you should never share your passwords, banking information, social media account access, or address online. And keep in mind that identity theft isn't the only risk with of a lack of cyber security, so some details are riskier to share than you'd expect. Other information, like details about your relationship, could be used to figure out answers to your security questions or even give hackers a tip-off when it comes to guessing your password.</p><br><br>

<div id="Div2">
<h2>Double-check any links before you click</h2>
<p>One way to tell if a link is safe is to mouse over it. This will show a preview of the full link in your web browser’s status bar. Check to make sure the preview link matches the site it should be from—you can verify the correct site link by googling the company name.</p><br><br>

<div id="Div3">
<h2>Use a VPN with your Wi-Fi connection</h2>
      <p>A VPN, or virtual private network, securely connects your device to an internet server so that no one can monitor your activity or access your data through your internet connection. It’s a great (and legal) way to keep your connection secure at home and even while you’re out and about using public Wi-Fi.</p><br><br>
</div>
<div id="Div4">
      <h2>Only log into sites that start with https://</h2>
<p>Need to see your checking account balance? If you’re about to log into any site, make sure the address at the top of your web browser starts with https:// and not http://. You may also see a padlock symbol next to the site address. The “S” stands for “secure,” and it means the site is encrypting your data.</p><br><br>
</div>
<div id="Div5">
<h2>Use antivirus and antimalware software</h2>
  <p>You should never surf the web without protection in place. Even if you’re on a budget, you can find free and low-cost antivirus software.</p><br><br>
    </div>
<div id="Div6">
  <h2>Create and use complex passwords</h2>
    <p>Yup, we’re gonna beat that drum: you should always use complex passwords to improve internet safety. A strong password can do a lot to deter cyber criminals. And if your password is listed in the top 200 commonly used passwords (or if it’s similar to any of these, to be honest), you should change it. Now. It also won't hurt to enable a multi-factor authentication where possible.</p><br><br>
